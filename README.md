Customer Purchase Prediction using Decision Tree Classifier

Overview:

This project aims to build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The classifier is trained on a dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, specifically the Bank Marketing dataset.

Dataset:

The dataset used in this project is the Bank Marketing dataset, which contains information about marketing campaigns for a Portuguese banking institution. It includes features such as customer demographics (age, job, marital status), previous campaign information (contact type, last contact duration), and whether the customer subscribed to a term deposit.

Objective:

The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral attributes. By training a decision tree classifier on historical data, we aim to identify patterns and relationships in the data that can help in predicting customer purchase behavior.

Methodology:

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, categorical variables, and outliers.

Feature Selection: Relevant features are selected based on their importance and contribution to the prediction task.

Model Training: A decision tree classifier is trained on the preprocessed data to learn patterns and relationships between the input features and the target variable.

Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using appropriate performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its predictive performance.

Model Deployment: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed in production to make predictions on new, unseen data.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the application of a decision tree classifier for predicting customer purchase behavior based on demographic and behavioral data. The trained model can be used by businesses to optimize marketing strategies and target customers more effectively, ultimately leading to improved sales and customer satisfaction.
